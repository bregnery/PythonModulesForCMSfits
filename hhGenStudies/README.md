# HH MC Generation Plots

This directory contains programs that plot results of privately generated HH Monte Carlo samples.
The Monte Carlo was generated with the process found in my [hhMCgenerator](https://github.com/bregnery/hhMCgenerator)

## Instructions

These programs requires ``CMSSW_9_X`` and can be run with:

```bash
cmsenv
python hhmcGenStudies.py
```

## Notes

``hhmcGenStudies.py`` is the most up to date of these files, the others may contain errors.
