# Plots for BEST HH Studies

This directory is for making plots to study the results of using BEST on HH Monte Carlo. This 
requires a root file titled ``best_HH_results.root`` which must be created with my 
[BEST HH EDAnalyzer](https://github.com/bregnery/BESTHHedmanalyzer).

# Instructions

These programs require ``CMSSW_9_X`` and can be run with:


```bash
cmsenv
python bestHHplots.py
```
